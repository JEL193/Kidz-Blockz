# Kidz Blocks
Our project will be a web based application hosting an assortment of educational (or classic) games, which tracks the users performance. The games will likely be geared toward education, with a target audience of adults with small children, whom they are able to play the games along side with.

# General Information
## 1: Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?
Jake Elrod, Robert Bonham, Robert Elizondo, Jacob Lopez, Oscar Fortanel Benitiez
## 2: What you’re creating?
Our group is creating an educational website which features games that are geared towards educating young children ideally grades 1st-5th. The user should be able to choose an age group and will be given a selection of games to play based on their age group. We would also like to implement a leaderboard for each game or some type of data we can return to the player. We will implement a responsive web design to cater to younger ages preferring handheld devices. 
The trend of technology is heading towards web-based applications and having experience building that type of application will allow the developers in this group to talk confidently about our experiences working with the technologies surrounding web-based design to future employers. 
## 3: Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?
Our primary audience would be adults with small children, who want an interactive way to have fun teaching their children basic ideas. The experience should be fun for both the parent and the child. The parent that is looking to educate their children will be primary audience sought-after. The age range of parents will be from 20 – 40 years old and the age range of children will be from 3-10 years of age. 
## 4: Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?
From this project we hope to gain the ability to make a frictionless webpage which could potentially be transformed into a model application. Learning how to create an interactive website that is easy enough to be used by children will be a new feat. We hope to gain insight on how to piece together a coherent series of interactive web pages that could later be adapted into a mobile application. We hope that this web application will impact underprivileged youth and enable them to perform at a higher level during the beginning of their scholastic career.

## Missing
We are missing web game development experience. None of the developers have ever built a web based interactive game. Also lack in design, this will be important because the design must be simplistic for our audience base.

# Features
* Simple UI Web App - A web application with a simple and responsive UI
    * Relevant Story: I, Jake, as a student of Texas State University who is also trying to raise a young child would like to be able to educate my child while also having an interactive simplistic interface. This way I can educate my child instead of entertaining the child with mindless games.
* Multiple Game Options - We are creating a simple but engaging single page web app designed for younger kids. This application will be visualy stimulating but user friendly.

# Sprint 1 - Contributions and Next Steps
* Robert Bonham
    * Jira: KID-38 - Implement a drop menu for a sidebar menu
        * For this task I implented the sidebar for easier navigation between games.
    * Jira: KID-48 - Restructure Files for KidzBlocks to be easily navigated and for future components to be added
        * I restructure the files for future development to make putting new implementation in the correct files.
    * Jira: KID-33 - Determine what elements should be included on each webpages, and where they should be included (things like logo, navigation menu, and buttons)
        * For the first sprint I just went with whatever what necessary at the time of implemenation and expect for the elements to be switched out for a more unified agreement between the team.
    * Jira: KID-30 - Create a simple navigation interface for users to transition between games easily
        * https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-betazoids/kidzblocks/commits/ea1fd5ab92f54898b49234a0fd9387489a0d6dbb
    * Jira: KID-44 - Research how to create a separate page after selecting a game
        * The information to do this is avaiable in the Research-files/Research-notes file named Linker
        * https://bitbucket.org/cs3398-s22-betazoids/kidzblocks/commits/2138d81de4c259d0de36c4cf40877a44052038a5
    * Jira: KID-18 - Three Game Web Pages
        * After restructing the file system i was able to create the three webpages for each of the grade groups we decided as a team. 
    * Next Steps: I will likely begin researching and implementing the games the team have found during the first sprint to be added to their respected game pages.
