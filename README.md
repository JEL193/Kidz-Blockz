# Building Blocks
Our project will be a web based application hosting an assortment of educational (or classic) games, which tracks the users performance. The games will likely be geared toward education, with a target audience of adults with small children, whom they are able to play the games along side with.

# General Information
## 1: Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?
Jake Elrod, Robert Bonham, Robert Elizondo, Jacob Lopez, Oscar Fortanel Benitiez
## 2: What you’re creating?
Our group is creating an educational website which features games that are geared towards educating young children not yet in or just starting school. The player should be able to choose an age group and will be given a selection of games to play based on their age group. We are creating a website which would include games focused on education for younger kids. We will categorize the games by age groups from which the user will be able to choose. We would also like to implement a leaderboard for each game we include. The trend of technology is heading towards web-based applications and having experience building that type of application will allow the developers in this group to talk confidently about our experiences working with the technologies surrounding web-based design to future employers. 
## 3: Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?
Our primary audience would be adults with small children, who want an interactive way to have fun teaching their children basic ideas. The experience should be fun for both the parent and the child. The parent that is looking to educate their children will be primary audience sought-after. The age range of parents will be from 20 – 40 years old and the age range of children will be from 3-10 years of age. 
## 4: Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?
From this project we hope to gain the ability to make a frictionless webpage which could potentially be transformed into a model application. Learning how to create an interactive website that is easy enough to be used by children will be a new feat. We hope to gain insight on how to piece together a coherent series of interactive web pages that could later be adapted into a mobile application. We hope that this web application will impact underprivileged youth and enable them to perform at a higher level during the beginning of their scholastic career.

## Missing
We are missing web game development experience. None of the developers have ever built a web based interactive game. Also lack in design, this will be important because the design must be simplistic for our audience base.  

# Technologies Used
* JavaScript/ReactJS
* CSS/Bootstrap
* React Router
* Material UI
* NPM/NPX
* Firebase(Database)

# Features
* Multiple Game Options - The user should have an assortment of options for what games to play depending on their input age group.
* User progress tracking - Keeps track of how well the user has performed over time. May add features to send a progress report to a specified email at regular intervals.
    * Relevant Story: I, Robert, would like to create a web application that allows you to play classic games that a score how well someone did
	* Relevant Story: I, Jake, as a student of Texas State University who is also trying to raise a young child would like to be able to educate my child while also having an interactive simplistic interface. This way I can educate my child instead of entertaining the child with mindless games.
    * Relevant Story: I, Elrod, as a person who is trying to increase their Childs education would like to be able to view all the activities and gather real time data about the education my child is receiving. This product will allow the user children to receive a better education.
* Leaderboard - Displays the top-performers out of all users of the application.
